This is where I got the information on how to do most of the things.

This where I installed the Raspberrypi Imager. With this application, you can image a SD-Card to have the proper OS for your raspberrypi installed before you put it in. This will obviously come to hand when we are going to be setting up the clusterÂ´s software.

Whilst I was doing this, my father made a nice image to show what we will need for the cluster to work. We will need to assign static IPs to all of the individual piZs, edit the host file and include important network information, create a number of ssh keys and connections to all of the piZs and much more. All of that is included in the following plantuml iamge.

We then downlaoded docker and set it up witht the help of this video.

A few steps might have to be done deifferently, especially when one gets to the point to initialize the swarm. There we had to log int our own router and assign the static IPs for all of the nodes (piZ1, piZ2, piZ3, piZ4). When doing so, it is important to specify the leasetime to infinite to prevent the IPs from changing later. I would recommend always looking at the settings from the command "ip a" before changing the IPs and MACs on your router.
